<h1>About Me</h1>
        
<section>
  <h2>Who is ChobbyCode?</h2>
  I'm Jacob Hadfield, or as I go on the internet Chobby. Why I go by Chobby, if your wondering, is because when my sister was younger she couldn't properly pronounce my name so she pronounced it as that. Since the age of eight, I have being programming. It is one of my long term hobbies. Unfortunately, due to the recent development in AI, I don't see it to be a viable career path for me anymore, however I would still be happy work in a related job sector such as quantum computing. Instead I am now opting into my other interests of chemical engineering.
