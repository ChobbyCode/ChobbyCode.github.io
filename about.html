            This website is a website for <a href="https://github.com/ChobbyCode">ChobbyCode</a>. This website's main purpose is to be a hosting ground of Chobby's Code (ha) & other projects, you will be able to get links
            to different products that I have created.<br>
            <br>
            Now as a person, I hate whitespace... so that is why I always use "Dark Space". I think it looks better, it certainly doesn't hurt your eyes (as much). I also hate text... bit funny that this page is just text then.

            Personally I think the amount of utility apps out there, isn't enough, and especially, there isn't enough free ones. I make a lot of utility apps for a range of divisions, although I may not release them on github all the time,
            I mainly give them to my friends. <!-- Please remove the next bit once finished --> I'm currently working on a Macro App, a while ago... like over a year ago, I made this simple macro app using Dotnet 4.8 (yikes), and it
            utilised System.Windows.Forms (Even more yikes) to quickly automate sending and typing, as I needed a quick way to not go AFK in minecraft. And why did I not download anything? It all costs money. This app I have rewritten
            from the grounds up with Auto Update Checking, Saving Macros, Settings and more I have built this on <a href="https://github.com/TChatzigiannakis/InputSimulatorPlus">InputSimulatorPlus</a> which is much better.<br>
