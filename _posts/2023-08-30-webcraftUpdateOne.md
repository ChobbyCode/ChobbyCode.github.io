> ## What is webcraft?

Webcraft is a Minecraft Clone I am currently working on. It is made in three.js which is a graphics library for javascript and typescript. The project should be done in 2-3 weeks and I will make a youtube video on my youtube channel. In the mean while, you should check out my youtube channel. Plug.

Currently, I have got the world generation working and next I am going to work on adding new blocks and been able to remove blocks.

The world currently looks like this:
