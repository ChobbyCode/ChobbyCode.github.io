Before starting this blog, I should state I am far from being a physicist, or in anyway experienced in this field. I am fifteen year old student with no prior experience. The following content is of my own speculations, because I had an idea, and thought that it is actually some what viable as it explains a few things. If there is any mistakes in my reasoning then please leave an issue on github to this exact file.

# What is string theory?

I am going to take into account that if you're reading this you some what understand string theory. If not, I am going to give a brief summary of what I think it is. String theory is the belief that all quantum particles are made of strings which can either be folded, or not. These then oscillate in specific ways which can represent different particles in our universe. I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7cOlBxtKSo) which sent me on this spiral, I recommend watching it as I cannot explain it as good as the video did. The reason string theory is commonly accepted is because it includes gravitons successfully in the standard model.

However, one problem illustrated in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7cOlBxtKSo) is that string theory suggests that there is ten dimensions in our universe when we can only observe 4 of them (3 dimensional movement, and time). This leaves us with 6 dimensions that we cannot observe. It is commonly accepted that these 6 (unseen) dimensions are extremely small, to the point we cannot see them, and that they wrap, and curl around each other. So they are that small it is impossible to observe with current technology.

# The speed of light

In summary, if you have not seen recently, a bunch of scientists did some stuff with some particles, and were able to work out that potentially the speed of light isn't constant (likewise any other constant in the universe). From what I have seen, there is not any evidence to support that it isn't constant, but the evidence, and research that they have done so far is suggesting this.

A common theory that has been circulating around the internet recently is that the different constants that we have are specific to different parts of the universe (this point is specific to the theory that I have so remember it for later). This would throw off all calculations of the universes size, as we'd have to recalculate it from scratch as the speed of light may be different everywhere. This would also have implications for us, as it would show that we exist in the exact perfect conditions (where possible) as matter (as we know it) can perfectly exist. In one part of the universe, the strength of gravity way be too weak so electrons are not able to bond to the nucleus of an atom, and in other parts of the universe it may be to strong to the point that chemical reactions cannot occur. So in our specific part of the universe all conditions are perfect for us to exist. This would have greater moral implications for war, which I won't be discussing in this blog.

Originally, when I learnt that the speed of light could potentially not be constant, my mind immediately jumped to saying that potentially we could control the speed of light in some form, and go faster than it. However, this is not seen as being possible due to relativity being a consequence of light's velocity.

# The six unseen dimensions

Linking back to the initial topic, there is six dimensions we cannot observe. These dimensions wrap around each other to the point they aren't visible to us.

This is where my theory starts, and my theory could work in two different ways:

## 1. Super Dimensions

Yes I know the name is cheesy.

For this section we are going to say that the six unseen dimensions are not small. Instead, we are going to say that the dimensions are actually giant (please hear me out on this).

So currently we think that the additional dimensions are that small we can't measure them. What if they were that big that we couldn't tell a difference between what's normal, and what isn't. We are also going to believe that the dimensions cannot be measured as a wave (I know this goes against pretty much every principle of quantum physics but whatever).

Example:
Let's say you're an ant, and you live in a rain forest. All you ever know is the rain forest. You can't see the desert that's only five kilometres to the right of you. But a bird (with the ability to fly up) can see this desert. So let's say in our universe we are an ant, we have only seen the universe from one specific set of conditions, we are too small (or better, don't have the ability to see from different positions) to see anything other than our norm. Therefore, we are unable to measure any differences in these dimensions because they are that giant compared to us. They could potentially be the size of millions of galaxies.

String theory also suggests that the shape, and oscillation of the strings could potentially change as you move throughout the universe. The change in these Super Dimensions (as I've been calling them because they are Super Big) then therefore could affect this change in oscillation, or structure of the particles.

If we took my first approach to thinking at it this way, it would explain a few unexplained things. 1) The unmeasurable six dimensions. 2) Non-constant constants.

If we look at this on a more sub molecular scale, we could say that a photon's speed is affected by the way that the oscillation occurs within the string. So the Super Dimensions then affect the oscillation of the string thus affecting the speed of light, and other constants throughout the universe.

## 2. The Super Dimension

Let's take the previous theory, but instead of saying all of the six dimensions are Super Dimensions, only one of them is. This dimension then controls every other dimension, so space, time, magnetic fields, etcetera. This could be similar to how gravity can distort time which causes attraction between objects.

We would also have to consider that this one singular Super Dimension does not progress linearly. It could be random, or quadratic, or follow a trend of the concentration of matter in certain parts of the universe. This would show how random spots of the universe have a different entire speed of light to ours, and how there is no pattern to it. This could also be expressed as a force, or even a wave (however waves will have a constant oscillation which varies which would mean it could be predicted) in this model we are stating that this Super Dimension cannot be predicted due to it being random.

If this Super Dimension were to be expressed as a wave, the wave length would have to be utter billions of years (potentially as old as the universe) to the point we cannot measure a difference in anything.

## Overall

Overall, my theory is that there is these Super Dimensions which span the width, and height of the universe changing so little that it cannot be observed, but enough to the point it can affect the vibrations of strings in string theory affecting what particles we have access to here, and the speed of different particles.

Note: The theory of the curling of the six dimensions suggests that particles could have no mass, but the particles moves through the six dimensions making it appear to have a mass.

The name of this theory will be 'Super Dimensional Theory'

# Dark matter

Somehow, I thought of a way to link this to dark matter. Dark matter is a big way of scientists saying "We don't know". If we were to link my theory into this, dark matter could be the Super Dimension. And what we observe as dark matter is actually these small inconsistencies within the super dimension.

# Condolences

I am not a scientist, just a young boy who happened to have an idea that I thought could be alright, so I decided to publish it on the internet. Please take this write up with a pinch of salt.
