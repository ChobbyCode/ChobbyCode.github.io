# Who am I?

I'm ChobbyCode, a 14 year old self-taught programmer who somehow manages to program 18 hours a day, with having 14 hours of sleep, and 8 hours of school: if I'm doing my math correctly, 18 + 14 + 8 = 40, which yeah that's makes sense...

I am a C# Dotnet developer, but sometimes venture off into other uncharted lands.

# Why this website?

I originally made a youtube video on github pages, and how to create one. I did this originally, to see if social media would be a viable career for programming, however it seems tutorial content is quite hard to do... "I think I'll leave that one to Brackeys, BroCode, and Tim Corey".

I originally created this website back in September of '23, when my webdev skills were not as pollished as they are now; as time grew the original website became outdated, and bland, not suiting the needs of what I wanted, so I admittedly left it. Then all of a sudden "let's make it from scratch". 

And then I recreated this website. This website is not one of my most spherical works as I tried to recreate it in react, but gave up, and then back to Jekyll we are... 

This version now suits my needs better, and I will make sure to put monthly to fortnightly blogs on here talking about certain topics that I find interesting. Don't expect these blogs to be your Saturday night crumpet & tea, as sometimes you may become lost when it is a lost as a wild dog.
