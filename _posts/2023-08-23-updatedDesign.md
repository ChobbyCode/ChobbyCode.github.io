    Don't use h3 tags as they appear as seperate posts

I have updated the entire design of the website. The layout is basically the same, but the actual colours and theme of the website is a lot better. 

I'm going to work on integrating github comments into the website. For example, there will be a link you can click on this post and it will take you to the github comments of this post. There, you will be able to comment and they will show up on the website. This will be so I can resolve issues.
