For this blog post, Super Sup Dimensions will be shortened to the shorthand of SSDT (Super Sub Dimensional Theory)

# A Few Discrepancies

I would recommend reading my previous blog post, though that is utter moonshine. Instead, I will summarise what SSDT is here.

SSDT is my belief that there is a large (invisible) force spanning extreme lengths. My idea of this comes from string theory where there is six dimensions that we cannot prove exist. Usually, the common belief is that the six dimensions fold in on themselves, so we cannot observe them. Instead I think they’re gigantic. 

Since the last blog post, I have changed a few of my views on what I believe my views on SSDT are. Firstly, I want to express that I think that these dimensions are expressed as waves with extremely long wave lengths. These would obviously have to be a transversal wave as there is no medium in space for a longitudinal wave to travel through. This means that we’re either on the peak or trough of the wave. It is technically possible for a wave of infinite wave length to exist, so could this be it? 

Yes, I know this is all moonshine, however leave me alone with my ideas, they are some what plausible to an extent. If I’m able to be a scientist when I’m older I will try and research into whether this is true. 
# Last Time On This Unconventional Blog Series 

In the last blog post, we discussed my ridiculous idea of Super Dimensions (I probably need to come up with a better name), and that there is this ultra large force which spans the entirety of the universe. This force is a wave with an extremely long wave length, and is extremely massive compared to us, so we cannot measure it.

Since then, NASA has released jaw dropping information information about the universe. Put simply, they used the James Webb Telescope to observe a hell a lot of galaxies. They should have seen that a large majority of the galaxies were isotropic (which means they spin in different directions, so half left, and half left for example), however a large myriad of galaxies were spinning in the same direction.

Note: It did release before my blog post, but I was unaware of it until the 28th of March.

This could obviously mean a few things…

1. The universe could have possible been born spinning, and the galaxies inherited the kinetic energy of the universe. This wouldn’t explain the other galaxies spinning in the wrong direction, unless they were born after all the other galaxies, but I am unaware of any information on this currently. We’re going to call this the Big Spinning Theory for the remainder of the blog post.
2. We exist in a black hole. This is because on a large scale it shows that the universe may not be how we thought it was structured. We are going to call this the Big Black Hole Theory for the remainder of this blog post. 

### Can We Link Big Spinning Theory To SSDF? 

I’m going to say no. Why would the universe spinning cause an extremely large force completely unobservable? It spinning would obviously cause forces to be applied on things, but they’d be observable, and in this case we’d be able to observe it as displacement/movement. So if the universe was just spinning real fast it would disprove my theory, unless, somehow, it created a massive force/wave which was pretty much constant without much change within it.

### Can We Link Big Black Hole Theory To SSDF?

I’m going to say yes. Let’s take our current knowledge of blackholes, they have extremely large gravitational forces, and everything gets squashed. If you were able to stay intact within the black hole, at one specific part without moving, I would assume that the gravitational force would feel constant.

The next problem we see to linking this to SSDF is that, would the force be a wave? As the black hole grows, the gravitational force applied would increase causing an increase in wave length. We already know that black holes produce an extremely large gravitational wave when colliding. There could be an extremely large gravitational wave inside them too.

If we took this to our universe, wouldn’t we have the exact same conditions? The exact same forces which we can observe within a black hole? 

# Condolences

That’s just an update of my idea. I don’t want to go over board on something that’s probably not true. It’s just a cool, some what plausible, idea that I had. If it comes out to be true, and accurate, I want my noble prize, you hear me?
