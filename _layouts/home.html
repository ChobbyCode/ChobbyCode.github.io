            <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Hi, I'm ChobbyCode/Techplain(yt). I make a lot of NuGet packages which make certain aspects of coding easier.<br> I do this to remove really stubborn tasks which
                usually take a god awful amount of time to complete for very little reward, and I make it a two click step.

            <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">What is #2ClickUsage?</h2>
            <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">
                To void legal issues, I'm first going to say it's not 2 click usage depending on what you are doing, but more 4ish clicks but 2 sounds<br>
                 better and it goes of the tongue just better. I strive to make coding take less and less code and be more<br> accessible to a wider range of people.
