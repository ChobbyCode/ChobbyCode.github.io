### Contact

To contact me you can either email me at my email address or simply comment on one of my youtube videos. You will be able to find my email address on my youtube on the 'about' section and by clicking reveal email address.

I may not always be able to email back straight away, but hopefully I do within a few days. If you do not receive an email within a week, please make a follow up email as I may have gotten a lot of emails.

Please do NOT email me any spam or irrelevant content as I will block you and if we need to make actual email chains in the future we will not.

If you have an issue with a product and want to email me about that, DO NOT email me about an issue with a product, instead please make an issue request with the selected product on github because this will go onto an issue tracker instead of my emails. If you have a question about an app, make a discussion on github and do not email me.

To clarify, do not email me unless: business deal, cannot be done on github, really important. If you don't follow these I will let you off the first time, however if it consistent I will block you permanently.

In summary, only email my business email if you need to make a business deal, it is important or the action cannot be taken on github and if it is not one of these I will let you off the first time then block you if you continue to do this.
