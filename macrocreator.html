                <h3>What is MacroCreator?</h3>
                <p>
                    MacroCreator is a macro creating software, developed by <b><a href="https://chobbycode.github.io/index.html">ChobbyCode</a></b>, which allows you to create Macros. You can make a quick Macro, load a Macro from a save file or run program specific Macro.
                    Quick Macros allow for the least amount of detail, with Program Specific Macros having the most detail, with very microscopic changes to be made. MacroCreator is currently in development, but you should be able to download it soon.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can nolonger download older versions of MacroCreator such as V0.1.0 as they are not secure, and meet ChobbyCode's latest Security Minimum. When V1.0.0 is complete, you will be able to download it at https://github.com/ChobbyCode/MacroCreator.
