    <h3 class="title">Brand Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        The following listed elements are guidelines and are NOT supposed to be followed strictly. It is advised you following them as it helps to improve both ChobbyCode's (me) / Techplain (me) and your 
        reputation and brand reputation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Positive Vibes<br>
    </p>
    <div class="legal-definition">
        Use ChobbyCode's products in a positive way that doesn't cause direct harm to to other people. This harm may be physical, verbal, visual, cyber, and or any other ways of causing harm to others. However, you are exempt of this as long as the other person, party, or other person is agreeing to the harm
    </div>
    <p>
        2. Credits<br>
    </p>
    <div class="legal-definition">
        As my products will regularly come under the MIT License, I don't expect credit to be given. However, just a good practice and good posture I do ask that you could please write "Credits ChobbyCode" near the code which has been made by me, or at the top of the file saying "Credits ChobbyCode for [insert product here]."
